ℹ️ This repository is an experimental fork of flecs-engine with work-in-progress Windows support. Windows builds currently require Visual Studio C++ build tools, CMake, Ninja, and network access during configure so CMake can fetch dependencies and the prebuilt `wgpu-native` archive. The Windows launcher scripts use `vswhere` to enter the MSVC developer environment automatically.

# Flecs engine
A fast, portable, low footprint, opinionated (but hackable), flecs native game engine.

## Usage
Build & run the engine:
```sh
cmake -S . -B build/debug -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build/debug --config Debug
./build/debug/flecs_engine
```

On Windows:
```bat
run.bat
run-release.bat
```
Or use VS Code with CMake Tools.


## Why should I use this?
You should probably not use this, unless:
- you want to quickly prototype ideas
- you want to build an engine but not start from 0
- you're OK with the limitations of the engine
